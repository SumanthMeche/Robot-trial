# Robot-trial

# This is a trial code for my Robotics project

# I first planned to set the robot in initial position{fn}

# Then run Image recognition to Identify the April Tags{fn}

# Then get the centroid of those Tags individually{fn}

# Adjust the point in image coordinate to camera coordinate using calibrated camera parameters in a {fn}

# Then calculate and convert the points in camera coordinate to robot's base configuration {fn}

# I would call a function which already has my robot's congifiguration and joint limits 
# In the form of a Rigid Body {fn}

# And solve a basic invKin problem in robots base configuartion {fn}

# Use potentiometer values to get feedback on whether a joint angle is reached {fn}

# Include all this for a single pick and place motion in Robot base coordinate
